## Who am I?

Hello, my name is **JuliÃ¡n Duque** _(pronounced hoolyAAn dOOkeh)_ and my pronouns are he/him. Iâ€™m originally from MedellÃ­n, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ and I currently live in St. Petersburg, FL ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

Iâ€™m a community leader, public speaker, and JavaScript/Node.js developer. Iâ€™m also an official Node.js collaborator (Emeritus).

I work at [Heroku](https://heroku.com) as a **Principal Developer Advocate**, where I create content and help developers build and scale their applications on the platform. My main areas of focus are:

- **Node.js ecosystem**
- **Generative AI (GenAI) and Agentic Apps**
- **Event-Driven Architectures**

Over the years, Iâ€™ve organized and supported several community events:

- **JSConf** and **NodeConf** in Colombia
- **Suncoast.js** in St. Petersburg, FL
- [MedellinJS](https://www.meetup.com/medellinjs/), which is now the largest JavaScript user group in Colombia with 8,500+ members

Iâ€™m also passionate about education. Iâ€™ve taught software development fundamentals, Generative AI and Agentic Applications, JavaScript, and Node.js through:

- Community workshops
- Professional training sessions
- Online platforms like [Platzi](https://platzi.com/)

Additionally, I helped build [Make It Real](https://makeitreal.camp/) in MedellÃ­n, teaching web programming and JavaScript fundamentals to new developers.

Feel free to connect if you want to chat about JavaScript, GenAI, Agentic Apps, or event-driven systems!
