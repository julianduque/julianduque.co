## Who am I?

Hello, my name is **JuliÃ¡n Duque** _(hoolyAAn dOOkeh)_ and my pronouns are He/Him; I'm from MedellÃ­n, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ but currently living in Tampa Bay, FL ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

I'm a community leader, public speaker, JavaScript/Node.js developer, and an official Node.js collaborator (Emeritus).

I work at [Salesforce](https://developer.salesforce.com) as a **Principal Developer Advocate**.

I've been organizing community conferences like **JSConf** and **NodeConf** in Colombia; I've also helped organize Suncoast.js in St. Petersburg, FL, and [MedellinJS](https://www.meetup.com/medellinjs/), which is currently the largest JavaScript user group in Colombia with 7300+ registered members.

I'm also passionate about education, and I've been teaching software development fundamentals, JavaScript, and Node.js through different community workshops, professional training engagements, and online platforms such as [Platzi](https://platzi.com/). I've also worked on education projects like [Make It Real](https://makeitreal.camp/) and the Coderise project as a volunteer, teaching web programming and JavaScript fundamentals to teens from 13 to 17 years old in MedellÃ­n, Colombia.
