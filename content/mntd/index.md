## What is MNTD?

**MNTD** (Mantid) is a collaborative learning project aimed at helping developers (including myself) learn web development technologies, with a focus on Node.js but not limited to it.

As my native language is Spanish, most of the content I create and the community I build is in Spanish. However, I'm also planning to create content in English.

## How?

The main idea is to utilize live streaming platforms to teach coding while learning it myself. This approach gives me the opportunity to learn new technologies and improve my skills while others watch and learn alongside me.

## Why?

I believe that the best way to learn is by doing and teaching others. This approach allows me to both upskill myself and help others upskill as they learn with me.
