## What is MNTD?

**MNTD** (Mantid) is a collaborative learning project that aims to help developers (and myself) to learn web development technologies, especially Node.js but not limited to it.

Since my native language is Spanish, most of the content I create and the community I build is in Spanish, but, I'm also planning to create content in English as well.

## How?

The main idea is to use live streaming platforms to teach coding while doing it myself, that gives me an opportunity to learn new technologies and to improve my skills while you watch and learn with me.

## Why?

I think the best way of learning is by doing and teaching it to others, so this is the best way for me to both, upskill myself and upskill those that are learning with me.
