Hello, my name is JuliÃ¡n Duque, I'm from MedellÃ­n, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ but currently living in Tampa Bay, FL ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

I'm a community leader, public speaker, JavaScript/Node.js evangelist, and an official Node.js collaborator (Emeritus). I work at [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) as a Lead Developer Advocate and previously organizing [JSConf](http://jsconf.co) and [NodeConf Colombia](http://nodeconf.co), also helped organize [Suncoast.js](https://www.meetup.com/suncoast-js/) in St. Petersburg, FL, and [MedellinJS](http://medellinjs.org), the largest JavaScript user group in Colombia with 4500+ registered members.

I'm also passionate about education, and I've been teaching software development fundamentals, JavaScript, and Node.js through different community workshops, professional training engagements, and online platforms such as [Platzi](https://platzi.com). Also, I've worked in education projects like [Make It Real](https://makeitreal.camp/) and the [Coderise](http://coderise.org) project as a volunteer, teaching web programming and JavaScript to teens from 13 to 17 years old in MedellÃ­n, Colombia.

Fun fact: I love praying mantises and other type of critters!
