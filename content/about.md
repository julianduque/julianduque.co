Hello, my name is Julián Duque, I'm from Medellín, Colombia ?? but currently living in St. Petersburg, FL (Tampa Bay, FL) ??.

I'm a community leader, public speaker, JavaScript/Node.js evangelist, and an official Node.js collaborator. I work at [NodeSource](https://nodesource.com) as a Solutions Architect and currently organizing [JSConf](http://jsconf.co) and [NodeConf Colombia](http://nodeconf.co) and helping organize [Suncoast.js](https://www.meetup.com/suncoast-js/) in St. Petersburg, FL, and [MedellinJS](http://medellinjs.org), the largest JavaScript user group in Colombia with 4000+ registered members.

I'm also passionate about education, and I've been teaching software development fundamentals, JavaScript, and Node.js through different community workshops, professional training engagements, and online platforms such as [Platzi](https://platzi.com). Also, I've worked in education projects like [Make It Real](https://makeitreal.camp/) and the [Coderise](http://coderise.org) project as a volunteer, teaching web programming and JavaScript to teens from 13 to 17 years old in Medellín, Colombia.

Fun fact: I love praying mantises ? and other type of critters ??!
