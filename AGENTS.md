# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `content/` holds Eleventy page sources, collections, and templates (`_includes/`, `utils/`, section folders).
- `assets/` stores author-managed CSS, fonts, and generated builds (`*-build.css`) consumed by the theme.
- `src/` contains browser JavaScript modules bundled via Rollup and exposed globally through `src/index.js`.
- `_11ty/` provides Eleventy helpers (RSS, HTML minify, responsive images). `_site/` is the generated outputâ€”never edit directly.
- `scripts/` houses build tooling such as `rollup.config.js` and automation helpers.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm install` installs dependencies (Volta pins Node 22.16 and pnpm 9.15).
- `pnpm dev` runs Eleventy, Rollup, and PostCSS watchers for local development at http://localhost:8080.
- `pnpm run build` produces production-ready JS/CSS bundles and renders the static site into `_site/`.
- `pnpm run lint` executes Markdownlint and ESLint; `pnpm run prettier:verify` checks formatting without writing changes.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- JavaScript follows ESLint (`eslint.config.js`) with Prettier integration; use 4-space indentation, `const`/`let`, and explicit exports.
- CSS lives in `assets/css/`; prefer utility-first Tailwind classes in templates and keep custom selectors kebab-cased.
- Content files under `content/` should use lowercase, hyphenated slugs (e.g., `work/public-speaking.md`).

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated Jest-style suite; validate changes by running `pnpm run build` and checking the generated `_site/` for regressions.
- Run `pnpm dev` to interactively confirm navigation, search, and code highlighting behavior.
- Flag accessibility regressions by using browser devtools audits before merging.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Write short, present-tense commit subjects (`add new category`, `fix toc scroll`). Group related asset rebuilds with the code change.
- Ensure commits pass `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` locally; include the relevant commands in the PR description.
- Pull requests should outline the motivation, link related issues or posts, and include before/after screenshots for visual updates.

## Deployment Notes
- Production builds expect optimized CSS/JS artifacts; avoid committing `*-build.css` diffs unless intentionally regenerated.
- Secrets (API keys, Algolia credentials) load via `.env`; keep credentials out of commits and document required keys in the PR.
